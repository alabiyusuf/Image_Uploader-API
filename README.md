A Node.js server application where users can upload photos. The server handles file uploads using the multer middleware and saves the photos to the local disk. Additionally, it displays an HTML form allowing visitors to choose and upload picture files.

TO RUN THIS PROGRAM:

- Run npm install && nodemon app

Note: To save the uploaded images, make sure to establish a folder 'Images' in the project's root directory. The photos will be kept on the server in this folder.
